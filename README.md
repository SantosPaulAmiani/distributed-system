<h1>Distributed System</h1>

This folder contains files related to the implementation of a distributed system using Java. It showcases communication between multiple devices over a network using TCP sockets.

<h2>Files</h2>
<h3>localhostInfo.java:</h3> This Java file provides information about the local host, such as IP address and host name.
<h3>HostIp.java:</h3> This Java file demonstrates how to get the IP address of a specific host using its host name.
<h3>TCP-sockets/:</h3> This folder contains additional code related to TCP sockets, showcasing how to establish connections and transfer data between client and server applications.

<h2>How to Use</h2>

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:


git clone https://github.com/SantosPaulAmiani/Data-structures-.git

Navigate to the "Distributed System" folder on your local machine:


cd Distributed-System

Explore the individual Java files to understand their functionality and code implementation.

If you want to work with TCP sockets, navigate to the "TCP-sockets" folder:


cd TCP-sockets

Run the Java files using a Java development environment or the command-line interface (CLI) to see their output and understand the concepts demonstrated.
